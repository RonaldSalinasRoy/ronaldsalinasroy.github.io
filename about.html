    <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.<br>
        I am a graduate with distinction from Carleton University,
        having earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science along with a minor in Greek & Roman Studies.<br>
        You can find my resume <a href="Resources/Resume_Ronald_Salinas-Roy.pdf">here</a> and my CV <a href="Resources/CV_Ronald_Salinas-Roy.pdf">here</a>.
      </p>
    <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        My journey with Computer Science began in grade 11. 
        I was top in my class. In both grade 11 and 12, I participated in school board competitions. 
        It was fun seeing what I created come to life. 
        Then, I take my education further by attending Carleton University. 
        I successfully graduated with distinction. 
        Afterwards, I gave myself a much needed break. 
        Next, I wanted to expand my horizons by trying new things in life. 
        I took up jobs at a grocery store. 
        The experience was good for me, getting me out and more accustomed to the world. 
        It cultivated skills such as social and people skills. 
        After a while, I felt I was there long enough and yearned for more. 
        Now, I am looking to continue my growth with my degree, eagerly willing to learn and experience new things in life. 
        I hope to see you soon.
      </p>
